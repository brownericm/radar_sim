ENGIN 435:
  I just updated the program to be a little more flexible with inputs I hope. When you download the repo, you will now want to look cat the top_placeholder.py file. This file now manages the running of the program. Starting on line 20 there are several items that can be changed. The program expects either a 1-D Array Factor or a full 2D pattern intensity matrix. I can't deal with all the different possible normalizations, so please leave the data in dB, NOT normalized to 1. 
  
  There is a lot of commented garbage, I apologize I made these changes as fast as possible and I didn't sort through what needed to go for good or needed to be saved.

Signal Processing branch is for development of radar recieve while the ENGIN 465 class uses the code for the phased array project. Any useful additions for that class will be mirrored into master.
